# Invoicing Playwright Configuration Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Port Mismatch
- **Problem:** Playwright config and e2e tests were using port `3002`, but the web app runs on port `5173`
- **Fix:** Updated all references from `3002` to `5173`

### 2. Wrong Package Manager
- **Problem:** Playwright config was using `npm run dev`, but the project uses `bun`
- **Fix:** Changed command to `cd apps/web && bun run dev`

### 3. Server Output Visibility
- **Problem:** `stdout: 'ignore'` was hiding server startup messages
- **Fix:** Changed to `stdout: 'pipe'` to see server output for debugging

## Files Updated

1. `playwright.config.ts`
   - Changed `baseURL` from `http://localhost:3002` to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Changed `webServer.url` from `http://localhost:3002` to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Changed `webServer.command` from `npm run dev` to `cd apps/web && bun run dev`
   - Changed `stdout` from `'ignore'` to `'pipe'`

2. `e2e/app.spec.ts`
   - Updated all `http://localhost:3002` references to `http://localhost:5173`

3. `e2e/invoicing.spec.ts`
   - Updated all `http://localhost:3002` references to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Updated expect statements to check for `localhost:5173`

## Testing

To run the e2e tests:

```bash
cd invoicing
bunx playwright test
```

The web server will automatically start on port 5173 before running tests.

## Notes

- The web server command runs from the project root, so we need to `cd apps/web` first
- `reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI` will reuse an existing server if one is already running (useful for local development)
- Server timeout is set to 120 seconds (2 minutes) which should be enough for the dev server to start
- The `invoice-flows.spec.ts` file uses relative URLs (`/invoices`) which will work with the `baseURL` setting
